Read all of this before doing it.

Okay, how to set up your recaptcha.
Once you have your site installed on your server, you will need to get a recaptcha key.
Please follow the instructions you see in this video.

Once you have that done, in the video I say to set up a second account, but that is no longer necessary.
What you need to do it just point your browser to;

 www.YourSite.com/recap_test.php

If it says that its all good, then delete that file and enjoy. If not, then check your keys and if that failed,
feel free to contact us for further help.
